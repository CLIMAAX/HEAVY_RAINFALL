# Extreme precipitation: Changes under climate scenarios workflow.
Extreme precipitation is characterized by the occurrence of a large amount of rainfall within a short timeframe. The frequency and intensity of such extreme precipitation events are likely to change under the influence of climate change. These projected changes can translate to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods [urban and flash floods], as these result from the precipitation intensity exceeding the _critical rainfall thresholds_ of natural and artificial drainage systems capacities.

The following workflow focuses on presenting these changes in precipitation for specific durations, return periods, Global-Regional climate model pairs and RPCs (Representation Concentration Pathways). The generated information can be utilised to identify whether the local critical impact rainfall thresholds for infrastructures, vulnerable locations or areas are exceeded (or not) under the influence of climate change scenarios.

For this analysis, EURO-CORDEX climate projections for precipitation flux at a 12km spatial resolution have been employed. These projections are readily accessible to the public through the Climate Data Store portal.

In this section you will find:
1. Guidance on how to use the workflow for assessing the changes in critical impact rainfall thresholds within the context of risk assessment and climate change.
2. An advance user section where users with technical expertise can explore an example on how the intensities and return periods are calculated for a specific Global-Regional climate model pair and RCP. We have used the Catalonia region as an example and provide text to guide you on how the code can be modified according to your research interest.
 
We encourage you to explore the extreme precipitation workflow on your region!
