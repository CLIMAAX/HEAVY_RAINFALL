# Heavy rainfall
## Extreme precipitation - changes under climate scenarios

<span style="color:red">
This workflow is designed to help in exploring the local/regional risks presented by heavy rainfall (extreme precipitation), and assessing the impact of climate change on these risks. This is done with help of established climate datasets, supplemented with local knowledge ... {plain-language introduction on what to expect from this workflow}  

Maybe add an image illustrating heavy rainfall? (optional but nice to have)

Extreme precipitation is characterized by the occurrence of a large amount of rainfall within a short timeframe. The frequency and intensity of such extreme precipitation events are likely to change under the influence of climate change. These projected changes can translate to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods (urban and flash floods), as these result from the precipitation intensity exceeding the _critical rainfall thresholds_ of natural and artificial drainage systems capacities.  
  
The following workflow focuses on presenting the changes in precipitation for specific durations, return periods, Global-Regional climate model pairs and RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways). This information can be used to identify whether the local critical impact rainfall thresholds for infrastructures, vulnerable locations or areas are exceeded (or not) under the influence of climate change scenarios.  

In this analysis we use the EURO-CORDEX climate projections for precipitation flux at a 12 km spatial resolution. These projections are openly available to the public through the Climate Data Store portal.  

This workflow consists of several parts, where the user in guided in performing a risk assessment for heavy rainfall step by step, using climate data analysis supplemented with local information. In the next pages you will find:
1. **Local data requirements and interpretation for climate risk assessment** - Guidance on how to use the workflow for assessing the changes in critical impact rainfall thresholds within the context of a climate risk assessment.    
2. **Heavy rainfall hazard assessment using climate projections** - technical background information and code on how to use climate projection data to calculate precipitation intensities and return periods. We use Catalonia region in Spain as an example and provide text to guide you on how the code can be modified according to your research interest. 
*Note: This section is meant for advanced users and is not necessary to start with the risk assessment - pre-calculated hazard data is also available.*   
3. **Risk assessment methodology** - technical background and code on how to use hazard data to assess future risks due to heavy rainfall, illustrated for the example of Catalonia, Spain. 
4. **Risk assessment examples** - examples on how to use the extreme precipitation workflow to carry out a regional and local risk assessment by integrating the information provided in the above sections.
 
We encourage you to explore the extreme precipitation workflow on your region!
